* React
* React Router
* Redux
* Deployed with Netlify


### Synopsis
This is my portfolio website. The goal was to go with a simple color scheme
and keep everything straightforward. This is my experience and over here are
my projects. if you have any additional questions you can always send an email
to charles.lamb.dev@gmail.com


### when was this project created?
March 2021, and has been routinely updated since.


### Code Review
this project was initially started in 2021, however it used an old version of
React Router, later when React router changes several aspects of its codebase
this project stopped working correctly when I attempted to update it. It ended
being a quick fix but it taught me a valuable lesson about how software is 
always changing. something I will always keep in mind.

### final thought
I am very grateful for this project. It has developed through many iterations and is still evolving. It also represents my real portfolio/website so of course it has
a special place in my heart.
