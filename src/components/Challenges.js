During my experience learning as a developer i have had many ups and downs which have taught me two important things:

The learning never stops because the more I learn the more I realize I donâ€™t know
and
I learn the most valuable lessons from my most annoying mistakes unfortunately.
Below are a few of the most important coding challenges I have ever encountered
Because they taught me either programming patterns I did not know or triggered paradigm shifts that changed how I Handled challenges in the future. Click the icons to view these challenges and/or there respective audio descriptions where I explain exactly how I overcame them<br/> <br/>
Oh and in case you're wondering... yes that is me in the background overcoming one of my toughest physical challenges
